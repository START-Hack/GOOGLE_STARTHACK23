## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

Google is challenging you to come up with an innovative solution that helps individuals understand and reduce their personal impact on climate change. The final product can take any form but must involve a live demonstration with a technical component. Let's hack our way to a better future!

## <p align="center"> The Pitch: </p>

## <p align="center"> Data: </p>

Hackers can make use of any of the below datasets or any other government or vetted datasets they find themselves.

Company Datasets / APIs:
- Flights emissions: https://developers.google.com/travel/impact-model/docs/reference/rest/v1/insights/computeFlightEmissions
- Gmail API: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest
- Eco friendly routes: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes/eco-routes


Government Datasets:
- https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint

Other APIs / Datasets;
- Electricity Maps Free developer API: https://www.co2signal.com/

## <p align="center"> Technology: </p>

You can use Google Cloud's free offerings to access the flight emissions API, other free APIs, and some free hosting options. No specifc technology is suggested or required - use whichever technology that gets the job done and you're comfomable with.

## <p align="center"> Judging Criteria: </p>

Potential climate impact:
-	Can this solution achieve Incremental improvements for many people/businesses or 
-	Major improvements for few people/businesses? Creativity & innovation of solution: 
-	How original are these ideas? 

Technical sophistication & feasibility: 
-	Is this solution backed properly by different data sources or does it only use hardcoded demo data? 
-	How generalized is this technical solution? Does it only work in certain demo cases? 
-	Are there fundamental issues preventing a real implementation? 
-	We fully understand the time constraints of the Hackathon. Prototypical code and lack of automated tests is acceptable.
